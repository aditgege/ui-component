# Getting Started

There are several ways to get started with GITS UI:

- Via GITS CLI (recommended)
- Via Online Playground
- Manual Setup

## Via GITS CLI

The fastest way to get started with GITS UI is through our GITS CLI called `create-gits-app`. With this CLI, you create your project quickly with pre-made templates and even choose which module to add to your project.

To get started with GITS CLI, run this command in the terminal:

```
npx create-gits-app@latest
```

![](/create-gits-app.png)

Then, choose your prefered starter template or choose `Custom` to customize the module you want to add.

## Online Playground

You can also try the online playground on Stackblitz.
