# Introduction

GITS UI is a Vue component library that provides developers with a range of customizable and visually appealing user interface elements. Built using the latest version of Vue (Vue 3), GITS UI is designed for ease of use and customization, making it a powerful tool for creating engaging and professional-looking applications.

One of the key features of GITS UI is its integration with the popular CSS framework, Tailwind CSS. This allows developers to quickly prototype and build out the design of their applications, with a range of pre-designed styles and layouts to choose from.

In addition to its design capabilities, GITS UI is also built with customization in mind. Components can be easily modified using CSS properties, giving developers the ability to fine-tune the look and feel of their applications to meet their specific needs.

GITS UI is also designed for easy integration with Nuxt 3, making it a great choice for developers working on Vue-based projects. The library comes with TypeScript support out-of-the-box, providing an additional level of type safety and code organization.

In the future, GITS UI will include support for themes, allowing developers to easily change the overall appearance of their applications with a few simple changes.
